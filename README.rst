Python bindings to a subset of the `NUFFT algorithm
<http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html>`_.
Only the 1D/type 3 case is implemented but it's way faster
than Lomb-Scargle!

Python bindings by Dan Foreman-Mackey but the code that actually does
the work is from the Greengard lab at NYU (see `the website
<http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html>`_). For reasons of
compatibility, the whole project is GPLv2 licensed.
